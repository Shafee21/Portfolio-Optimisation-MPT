# Portfolio-Optimisation-MPT
This project was completed as part of the Financial Modelling module for my MSc in Investment Management. The aim was to construct an optimal portfolio using a given set of assets by maximizing the Sharpe Ratio, based on historical return and risk data.

As part of the analysis, I used two different approaches to model portfolio risk. The first approach was a standard method using a constant covariance matrix (non-GARCH), which assumes that asset volatilities and correlations remain stable over time. The second approach used a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to account for time-varying volatility, allowing the portfolio to better reflect changes in market conditions over time.

By comparing both methods, the project explored how different volatility assumptions can impact the calculation of portfolio risk and the resulting asset allocations.
